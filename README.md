Q2: Create a line chart illustrating the trend of impressions in 2023. 

• Trend of Impressions in 2023:
The data represents the trend of impressions throughout the year 2023, spanning from January 1st to July 23rd. Impressions refer to the number of times an ad is displayed or viewed. Looking at the numbers, I can observe fluctuations in impressions over time.

• On January 2nd, there were 316 impressions, indicating a relatively high level of ad visibility on that day. Conversely, on July 23rd, there were only 48 impressions, suggesting a decrease in ad visibility compared to previous days.
